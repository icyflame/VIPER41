Hi. My name is Siddharth Kannan. And this is the instructions file, that you may need to upgrade from VIPER 3 to VIPER 4.

Please follow the following steps.

<a href='mailto:kannan.siddharth12@gmail.com'>Mail Me</a> In case you have any doubt.

</p>

<p>
<pre>
(1) Download the appropriate zip file from the link. In case you want to upgrade then download the 'port.exe' file also.
(2) Create a folder named VIPER4 and then extract the zip archive there.
(3) Now go to the folder where you stored the VIPER3 executable. And copy the file 'pw.dat' here.
(4) Run the executable 'port.exe'. Now you will see that a new file 'viper' has been created.
(5) Now run the VIPER4 executable file that is there in the contents that you extracted from the downloaded zip archive.

<bold>NOTE:</bold> default master key is 'abcd'. Change it immediately as you log in for the first time.
</pre>

I hope you like this new release. This release has a complete GUI interface made with Python and Tkinter.

<a href='mailto:kannan.siddharth12@gmail.com'>Mail Me</a> if you have any suggestions to improve the software.
